# Oblique throw - Simple simulation
Simple simulation of the oblique throw, without air resistance.
This script visualizes a simulated oblique throw without friction forces. The initial velocity, the launch angle **alpha**, the location factor **g** and the launch height **h** can be varied as desired.
